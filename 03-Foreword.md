# Foreword | <mark>序言</mark>

The field of artificial intelligence is at a fascinating inflection point. We are moving beyond building models that can simply process information to creating intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and act to achieve complex goals with ambiguous tasks. These "agentic" systems, as this book so aptly describes them, represent the next frontier in AI, and their development is a challenge that excites and inspires us at Google.

<mark>人工智能领域正处在一个激动人心的转折点。我们正在从构建仅能处理信息的模型，迈向创造能够推理、规划和行动，以便在任务模糊的情况下达成复杂目标的智能系统。正如本书所精准描述的，这些「智能体」系统代表了 AI 的下一个前沿，其研发工作是一项挑战，也正是这份挑战在激励和鼓舞着我们谷歌的每一个人。</mark>

"Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems" arrives at the perfect moment to guide us on this journey. The book rightly points out that the power of large language models, the cognitive engines of these agents, must be harnessed with structure and thoughtful design. Just as design patterns revolutionized software engineering by providing a common language and reusable solutions to common problems, the agentic patterns in this book will be foundational for building robust, scalable, and reliable intelligent systems.

<mark>《智能体设计模式：构建智能系统的实践指南》恰逢其时，为我们的旅程指明方向。本书明确指出，作为这些智能体认知引擎的大语言模型，其强大的力量必须通过结构和精心的设计来驾驭。正如设计模式通过为常见问题提供通用语言和可复用的解决方案，为软件工程带来了革命性的变革一样，本书中的智能体模式也将成为构建稳健、可扩展、可靠智能系统的基石。</mark>

The metaphor of a "canvas" for building agentic systems is one that resonates deeply with our work on Google's Vertex AI platform. We strive to provide developers with the most powerful and flexible canvas on which to build the next generation of AI applications. This book provides the practical, hands-on guidance that will empower developers to use that canvas to its full potential. By exploring patterns from prompt chaining and tool use to agent-to-agent collaboration, self-correction, safety and guardrails, this book offers a comprehensive toolkit for any developer looking to build sophisticated AI agents.

<mark>将构建智能体系统比作一块「画布」，这个比喻与我们在谷歌 Vertex AI 平台上的工作产生了深刻的共鸣。我们致力于为开发者提供最强大、最灵活的画布，让他们能够在其上构建下一代 AI 应用。本书则提供了翔实的实战指导，赋能开发者充分发挥这块画布的全部潜力。通过探索从提示链、工具使用到智能体间协作、自我修正、安全性与护栏等一系列模式，本书为所有期望构建复杂 AI 智能体的开发者提供了一个全面的工具包。</mark>

The future of AI will be defined by the creativity and ingenuity of developers who can build these intelligent systems. "Agentic Design Patterns" is an indispensable resource that will help to unlock that creativity. It provides the essential knowledge and practical examples to not only understand the "what" and "why" of agentic systems, but also the "how."

<mark>AI 的未来将由那些能够构建智能系统的开发者的创造力和独创性来定义。《智能体设计模式》是释放这种创造力不可或缺的资源。它提供了必要的知识和实践示例，不仅帮助我们理解智能体系统「是什么」「为什么」，更能掌握「如何做」。</mark>

I am thrilled to see this book in the hands of the developer community. The patterns and principles within these pages will undoubtedly accelerate the development of innovative and impactful AI applications that will shape our world for years to come.

<mark>看到这本书能交到广大开发者社区的手中，我倍感激动。毫无疑问，书中所蕴含的模式与原则，将加速那些创新且影响深远的 AI 应用的开发进程，而这些应用将在未来数年里塑造我们的世界。</mark>
