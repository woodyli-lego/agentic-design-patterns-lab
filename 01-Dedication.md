# Dedication | <mark>献辞</mark>

To my son, Bruno,

who at two years old, brought a new and brilliant light into my life. As I explore the systems that will define our tomorrow, it is the world you will inherit that is foremost in my thoughts.

To my sons, Leonardo and Lorenzo, and my daughter Aurora,

My heart is filled with pride for the women and men you have become and the wonderful world you are building.

This book is about how to build intelligent tools, but it is dedicated to the profound hope that your generation will guide them with wisdom and compassion. The future is incredibly bright, for you and for us all, if we learn to use these powerful technologies to serve humanity and help it progress.

With all my love.
