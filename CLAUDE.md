This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **bilingual Chinese-English translation project** of "Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems" by Antonio Gulli. The project provides a comprehensive technical guide covering 21 core agentic design patterns for building intelligent AI systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pure documentation/translation project (no code to build, test, or run)
- All content is in Markdown format
- Uses HTML `<mark>` tags for Chinese text highlighting
- Follows strict bilingual format with English and Chinese side-by-side
- Original book has 424 pages across 21 chapters plus appendices

## Translation Format and Rules

### Mandatory Highlighting System

**All Chinese translations MUST use HTML `<mark>` tags:**
```markdown
English text here.

<mark>‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØëÂú®ËøôÈáå„ÄÇ</mark>
```

This creates yellow highlighting for Chinese content on GitHub, making it easy to distinguish between languages.

### Two Layout Formats

**1. Short Content (Dedication, Acknowledgment, Foreword):**
```markdown
## English | Ëã±Êñá
[Complete English content]

---

## Chinese | ‰∏≠Êñá
[Complete Chinese translation]
```

**2. Long Content (Chapters):**
```markdown
[English paragraph 1]

<mark>[‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØëÊÆµËêΩ 1]</mark>

[English paragraph 2]

<mark>[‰∏≠ÊñáÁøªËØëÊÆµËêΩ 2]</mark>
```

### Technical Term Conventions

Keep important terms in English with Chinese in parentheses on first use:
- Agent ‚Üí Êô∫ËÉΩ‰Ωì (Agent)
- Prompt Chaining ‚Üí ÊèêÁ§∫Èìæ (Prompt Chaining)
- RAG ‚Üí Ê£ÄÁ¥¢Â¢ûÂº∫ÁîüÊàê (RAG)
- Human-in-the-Loop ‚Üí ‰∫∫Âú®ÂõûË∑Ø‰∏≠ (Human-in-the-Loop)

Reference the technical term dictionary in rules.md:1-179 for consistent translations.

### Spacing Rules

- Add space between Chinese and English: `AI Á≥ªÁªü`
- Add space between Chinese and numbers: `21 ‰∏™Á´†ËäÇ`
- Use Chinese punctuation in Chinese context
- Use English punctuation in English context

### Format Requirements

- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections
- Add horizontal rules between level-2 headings for readability
- Preserve all original code example links (Google Colab/Drive)
- Maintain exact Markdown formatting from original
- Use proper Chinese quotation marks: „Äå„Äç or ""

## Translation Quality Standards

1. **Accuracy**: 100% faithful to original meaning
2. **Fluency**: Natural Chinese expression that follows local conventions
3. **Technical Precision**: Maintain technical document rigor
4. **Consistency**: Uniform terminology throughout
5. **Format Compliance**: 100% correct Markdown syntax

See rules.md:1-179 for complete translation guidelines.

## Project Status

The project is being translated chapter by chapter:
- ‚úÖ Completed: Dedication, Acknowledgment, Foreword
- üöß In Progress: Thought Leader's Perspective
- ‚è≥ Pending: Introduction and all chapters

Check README.md:33-87 for detailed progress tracking.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Translation

1. Follow the file naming convention (e.g., `07-Chapter-01.md`)
2. Use appropriate layout format (short vs. long content)
3. Apply `<mark>` tags to ALL Chinese text
4. Preserve original structure and links
5. Follow technical term dictionary for consistency
6. Update README.md checklist when complete

### Reviewing Translations

Check for:
- `<mark>` tags around all Chinese content
- Consistent technical term usage (check rules.md dictionary)
- Proper spacing between Chinese/English and numbers
- Horizontal rules between major sections
- All code links preserved and functional
- Correct Markdown syntax rendering

### Git Commit Messages

Use English commit messages with clear descriptions:
```
Add: [chapter name] translation
Update: [chapter name] formatting
Fix: [specific issue] in [chapter name]
```

## Important Notes

- **No build/test/run commands**: This is a pure documentation project
- **All files are Markdown**: No code compilation or execution needed
- **GitHub is the primary viewing platform**: Format optimized for GitHub rendering
- **Yellow highlighting is essential**: `<mark>` tags are mandatory for all Chinese text
- **Original book charity**: All royalties donated to Save the Children
- **License**: Translation released under CC BY 4.0
